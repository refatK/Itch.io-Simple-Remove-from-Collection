## INSTALLATION

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)/[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) browser extension.
2. Click [HERE](https://github.com/refatK/Itch.io-Simple-Remove-from-Collection/raw/main/ItchioSimpleRemoveFromCollection.user.js) and you should be prompted to install the script.

## PURPOSE

Usually you can only remove games from a collection in the collection page itself, but there's no way to search or sort within a collection and if your collection has many items it can be inconvenient to scroll through it just to remove a game. With this script you can simply go into the collection section of a game and remove it from any collection it's currently in.
